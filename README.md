# Installation

To run the buzzer client application, you need to install UniCurses which is a
platform independent wrapper library around the Curses library for building
text-based user interfaces (TUIs).  Download UniCurses from the following
website:

* https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyunicurses/

and follow the instructions to install the library on your machine.  Once done
you should be able to import the `unicurses` library from the interpreter like
this:

~~~ {.console}
$> python
Python 2.7.14 (default, Apr 10 2018, 13:57:49)

Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import unicurses
